\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc_conclucsion}

In this paper, we have presented the regional foods' features extracting algorithm and the experimental results. The experimetal results partially reflect the featured ingredients in regions. 

To show the feasibility and applicability of our algorithm, we build the cooking support system that helps cooking people transform the original recipes to have a featured taste of another regions.  

In this paper, the recipes from 7 regions of Japan are used. However, the proposed algorithm is scalable to adapt to any recipe from any region in the world. As a future work, we intent to develop a multilingual translation recipe with the function that can transform recipes between countries. 


\section{Future Works}\label{sec:conc_future}

In fact, the seasoning and non-seasoning ingredients affect the food's taste in different ways. Thus, we also develop the research in that direction, analyze food's features by applying different methods for seasiong ingredients and non-seasoning ingredients.
